## Create a program that stores a list of pages that have been tested and the results of which have been successful or failed.
1. Ask from user to enter the domain of the site. For example `example.com`
2. After entering the domain, ask the user to enter the links of 5 pages to be tested.
3. After each link is entered, ask them to enter 1 for pages with a `successful` test result and 0 for pages with a `failed` test result.
4. Find the number of pages where the test result was `successful` or `failed`.
5. In the end, show text like `5 pages are tested, n of them were succesfull and m of them failed`.
